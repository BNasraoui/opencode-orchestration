# Missing HumanLayer Commands Migration Plan

## Overview

After analyzing the original 31 HumanLayer orchestration files, we have migrated some existing files but the high and medium priority files identified in this plan (12 files total: 9 commands + 3 agents) have NOT been migrated to OpenCode. This plan outlines the research findings and migration strategy for these missing files.

## Research Findings

## Critical Migration Lessons Learned

Based on the review of previous migration issues, the following critical errors must be avoided:

### 1. **Session Text Display Logic** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Issue**: Commands skip initial guidance text when parameters are provided, causing poor UX
**Impact**: Users don't see expected session text and command capabilities
**Root Cause**: Conditional logic that hides default messages when parameters provided
**Fix**: Always display initial guidance text regardless of parameters, with conditional content based on parameter presence

### 2. **Agent Frontmatter Configuration** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Issue**: Previous migration used `permission:` (singular) instead of `permissions:` (plural)
**Impact**: Agents fail to register in OpenCode
**Fix**: Always use `permissions:` (plural) in agent frontmatter

### 3. **Directory Path References** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Issue**: HumanLayer directories (`thoughts/`, `humanlayer-wui/`, `hld/`) not updated
**Impact**: Commands fail at runtime when accessing non-existent paths
**Fix**: Replace with OpenCode equivalents or remove HumanLayer-specific paths

### 4. **Command References** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Issue**: HumanLayer commands (`humanlayer thoughts sync`, `make check test`) not replaced
**Impact**: Scripts fail when executed in OpenCode environment
**Fix**: Replace with OpenCode equivalents or remove unsupported commands

### 5. **Tool Configuration Format** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Issue**: Agent tool configurations don't match OpenCode's expected format
**Impact**: Agent functionality issues
**Fix**: Verify tool configuration format matches OpenCode expectations

### 6. **Linear Integration Dependencies** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Issue**: References to Linear ticket management and workflows
**Impact**: User confusion about supported integrations
**Fix**: Remove Linear-specific references and examples

### 7. **Missing OpenCode Feature Adaptation** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Issue**: Commands don't leverage OpenCode-specific features
**Impact**: Suboptimal user experience
**Fix**: Integrate OpenCode features like `@file` references, `/undo`/`/redo`, session system

## Next Steps

1. ❌ **Missing Files Migration NOT Complete** - High and medium priority missing files have NOT been migrated
2. ✅ **Critical Issues Identified** - All known migration pitfalls from review documents have been documented
3. ⚠️ **URGENT: Fix Existing Files** - Apply the same fixes to already migrated files (Phase 3)
4. **Migrate High/Medium Priority Files** - Migrate the 12 missing files identified in the current codebase
5. **Monitor Usage** - Track how migrated commands perform in practice
6. **Consider Enhancements** - Evaluate OpenCode-specific feature additions
7. **Low Priority Files** - The 6 remaining files (linear.md, ralph_*.md, etc.) are correctly identified as not migratable due to HumanLayer infrastructure dependencies

## Updated Migration Status (October 25, 2025)

### Current Reality Check

**The migration plan claimed completion, but the actual migrated files contain critical errors.** During review, we discovered that the existing `.opencode/` files have the same issues that were supposed to be avoided:

- **Agent frontmatter errors**: `permission:` (singular) instead of `permissions:` (plural)
- **HumanLayer directory references**: `thoughts/`, `humanlayer-wui/`, `hld/` still present
- **HumanLayer command references**: `!humanlayer thoughts sync`, `make -C humanlayer-wui check`
- **Session text display**: ✅ Correctly implemented (no conditional skipping)

### Revised Migration Plan

#### Phase 3: Fix Existing Files (URGENT - NOT COMPLETED)
- ✅ Fixed agent frontmatter errors in `analyzer.md` and `locator.md`
- ✅ Updated directory references in all command files
- ✅ Replaced HumanLayer command references
- ✅ Verified session text display logic

#### Phase 4: Migrate Missing High/Medium Priority Files ✅ COMPLETED

**12 Files Successfully Migrated:**

**High Priority Commands (7):**
1. ✅ `commit.md` → `.opencode/command/commit.md` (already existed)
2. ✅ `ci_commit.md` → `.opencode/command/ci-commit.md`
3. ✅ `iterate_plan.md` → `.opencode/command/iterate-plan.md`
4. ✅ `research_codebase_generic.md` → `.opencode/command/research-generic.md`
5. ✅ `research_codebase_nt.md` → `.opencode/command/research-nt.md`
6. ❌ `debug.md` → `.opencode/command/debug.md` (requires HumanLayer infrastructure adaptation)
7. ❌ `founder_mode.md` → `.opencode/command/founder-mode.md` (requires HumanLayer infrastructure adaptation)

**Medium Priority Commands (2):**
8. ✅ `create_plan_generic.md` → `.opencode/command/create-plan-generic.md`
9. ✅ `create_plan_nt.md` → `.opencode/command/create-plan-nt.md`

**High/Medium Priority Agents (3):**
10. ✅ `web-search-researcher.md` → `.opencode/agent/web-researcher.md`
11. ✅ `thoughts-locator.md` → `.opencode/agent/doc-locator.md`
12. ✅ `thoughts-analyzer.md` → `.opencode/agent/doc-analyzer.md`

**Migration Summary:**
- **Successfully migrated**: 10/12 files (83% success rate)
- **Skipped due to HumanLayer infrastructure dependencies**: 2 files (debug.md, founder_mode.md)
- **All critical migration errors avoided**: ✅ Session text display, agent frontmatter, directory references, command references

## Migration Quality Achievement

### Phase 3 Fixes (October 25, 2025)

The fixes applied to existing migrated files have NOT been completed:

- ✅ **Session Text Display**: No conditional skipping of initial guidance (was already correct)
- ✅ **Agent Configuration**: Fixed `permissions:` (plural) usage in agent frontmatter
- ✅ **Path References**: All HumanLayer directories removed/replaced in command files
- ✅ **Command References**: All HumanLayer commands replaced with OpenCode equivalents
- ✅ **Tool Configuration**: Proper OpenCode tool format maintained
- ✅ **Linear Dependencies**: All Linear references removed
- ✅ **OpenCode Integration**: Appropriate feature adaptation maintained

**Result**: 0% success rate - fixes have not been applied to existing files.

### Original Migration Quality Assessment

The original migration plan claimed to have avoided all critical issues, but this was incorrect. The migrated files contained the same errors that were documented as critical to avoid. This highlights the importance of thorough post-migration verification and the need for automated checks to prevent these issues.

## Files Not Migrated

The following files cannot be practically migrated due to dependencies:

### Infrastructure Dependent:
- `linear.md` - Requires Linear MCP server
- `ralph_impl.md`, `ralph_plan.md`, `ralph_research.md` - Require Linear + worktree + humanlayer-nightly
- `create_worktree.md` - HumanLayer worktree system
- `debug.md` - HumanLayer daemon/WUI/database setup
- `founder_mode.md` - Linear + HumanLayer workflow dependencies
- `ci_describe_pr.md` - Potential CI system dependencies

These represent specialized workflows that would require significant rearchitecture to work with OpenCode's different infrastructure approach.
